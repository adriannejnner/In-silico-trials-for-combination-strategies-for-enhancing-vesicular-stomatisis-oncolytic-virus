# In-silico-trials-for-combination-strategies-for-enhancing-vesicular-stomatisis-oncolytic-virus
In silico trial for a computational biology model of combined oncolytic vaccinia (an enhancer virus) and vesicular stomatisis virus (VSV).

Virtual patients are generated using "Commands_generating_virtual_patients.m". The samples parameters from a normal distribution and confirms they are wihtin 3 standard deviations of the average control tumour growth measured by Le Boeuf et al. (2010). Running the code, will create 200 sets of parameters that satisfy this condition. The code will then plot the patient tumour growth trajectoris (blue) with the average cohort trajectory (black) and mean measurements from Le Beouf et al. (2010) (red stars). The cohort parameters used in the manuscript can be found in "Cohort parameters.xls". An example output figure for the code is in "Cohort_trajectories.jpg".
